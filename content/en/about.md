## About TU Delft Library's Academic Heritage Team

*Please note: you are currently viewing a beta version of the academic heritage website of TU Delft Library. This website contains demo material for testing purposes and does not yet provide access to the full digital special collections. Should you encounter any bugs or other issues, please don't hesitate to [contact TU Delft Library](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/over-the-library/contact-en-bereikbaarheid/). The first official release is scheduled for November 2020.*

Since 2017, when TU Delft celebrated its 175th anniversary, the university has been investing in raising the profile of its academic heritage by improving the preservation of its collections, initiating research projects and organising on-campus presentations in collaboration with students and academic staff.

## Website
This website provides access to the different pillars of the academic heritage team of TU Delft Library: digital editions of exhibitions, digitised items from the special collections and research output.

Built according to the specifications of International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the website aims to promote creative reuse of TU Delft Library's digital special collections. For example, a special tool developed to curate digital exhibitions will become available to visitors. More information about the project and its use of IIIF can be found in this Medium article by Digirati's Technology Director Tom Crane: [Reaching into collections to tell stories](https://medium.com/digirati-ch/reaching-into-collections-to-tell-stories-3dc32a1772af).

## Special collections
The special collections of TU Delft Library consist of the Museum Collection and the Trésor:

#### Museum Collection
The Museum Collection includes objects that are retrieved from TU Delft's institutional history, academic education and research. The items range from measuring instruments, course material, demonstration devices and research collections, to art, such as professor portraits. The collection contains around 6,500 objects and reveals the history of the TU Delft. The objects can be taken on loan under museum conditions for public exhibitions hosted on or off the campus.

#### Trésor
The Trésor includes historic books, journals, maps, photographs and prints from before 1900. Their age, rarity, value or vulnerability is what makes them special. The Trésor also collects TU Delft output that is not usually included in academic journals, like speeches, dissertations and lecture notes.
