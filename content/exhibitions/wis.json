In the face of the continuing expansion of air traffic, mitigation of aviation's climate impact becomes challenging but imperative. Feijia Yin is committed to making aviation greener, hence reducing the climate impact of aviation. To this end, her research interests are in aircraft engine modeling, novel engine concepts, and climate assessment of aviation technologies and operational strategies. By working on this, she aims to identify the climate-neutral pathway for future aviation development. Her recent publication on the impact of hybrid-electric aircraft on contrail coverage has drawn intensive attention and is presented as a cover page story of the <em>Aerospace</em> journal.</p><p><strong>Biography</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Feijia Yin is an assistant professor at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft. She received her PhD degree in 2016 from TU Delft on modeling and characterizing a novel multi-fuel engine concept. Afterward, Feijia started her Postdoc research on assessing the climate impact of aviation and the effective mitigation strategies from operations and technologies. In 2019, she received the prestigious NWO VENI grant to evaluate the climate impact of future aircraft propulsion technologies. Her research on verification of NO<sub>x</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> algorithmic climate change functions received the best paper award in ICRAT 2018. She is a member of the IGTI Aero Engine Committee. She is currently involved in multiple EU projects on different sustainable aviation topics.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=climprop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=o_VZzCoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Scholar</a></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feijia_Yin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ResearchGate</a></p>"

The systems we inhabit as academics are flawed, based on a long history of bias and exclusion, and have been scientifically proven to hamper the progress of women, people of colour and differently abled people. Being aware of these factors, challenging them, and building strong support networks with allies is essential for any aspiring scientist.

This \"leaky pipeline\" stems from a range of social/organizational issues but the extent to which the physical, designed workplace influences these factors remains unexplored. Historically offices have been designed for men, often by men, yet little research exists on how workplace design affects workplace inequality.

                  "<p><strong>Advice for the next generation of female scientists</strong></p><p>I started this exciting journey many years ago. As a child, I was always curious about how things work and why humans behave the way we do. I wanted to know everything (and this tireless need for knowledge drove my parents crazy)! My determination to understand how to control machines brought me to the field of robotics, and my indefatigable need to understand human behavior drove me to the field of neuroscience. So, here is my advice: never lose curiosity. And do not listen to people who say that you will not be able to reach your goals!</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiAMzfIEbdc\" height=\"500\" width=\"800\"></iframe><p><strong>Research's Impact on Society</strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(37, 37, 37);\">Every year, millions of stroke survivors lose their functional autonomy due to paralysis, posing a tremendous societal and economic challenge. In absence of a cure for stroke, neuroscience evidence suggests that patients should engage in personalized, high-intensity training to maximize their recovery. I worked directly with stroke survivors and witnessed the potential for improvement that robotic devices and virtual reality can bring to their lives. Robots can deliver high-intensity training in an engaging virtual environment at a low cost. The goal of my research is to maximize patients' recovery by employing versatile robotic devices that provide personalized physical assistance in realistic and engaging virtual environments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Biography</strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(37, 37, 37);\">Laura Marchal-Crespo&nbsp;is an Associate Professor at the Department of Cognitive Robotics, Faculty 3mE, TU Delft since September 2020.

Always believe in yourself and in what you are doing; try to grow in a natural and organic way that's faithful to yourself, your values and your goals. I hope you will be protected with loving and supporting people around you to enhance your growth. Research and science is not something that you do alone in a corner; you need to gather people around you with whom you can communicate and work, forming a real team of which the members mutually reinforce each other. Make sure to learn both from teachers and students. Allow yourself that be taken by the hand by others who may lighten parts of your path. To all the strong women out there: allow your heart to open, be kind and gentle to yourself, and remember that even in your loneliest moments, you are never really alone; if anything, you always have yourself!</p><p><strong>Research's Impact on Society</strong></p><p>My research is situated on the bridge connecting materials science to design. My main research topic focuses on investigating the properties of shape memory materials (alloys, polymers and composites) and applying them as active elements in designing shape morphing objects. This gives free rein to designers' creativity to make interactive objects which have a dynamic relation with users. A number of good practices designed under my supervision include deployable structures, self-sizable adaptable shoes, self-sizable grips, self-regulating jackets and soft mobile devices. My 20-year experience in materials science and engineering helps me to do systematic research and design better controllable and programmable objects which are reliable, accurate and sustainable.</p><p><strong>Biography</strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Sepideh Ghodrat is assistant professor of Shape Morphing Design at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering.

Their underrepresentation in leading scientific positions is rather a matter of life priorities as a result of natureâ€™s calling to have a healthy family. Excellence and dedication are the only qualities that are the key to a scientific career today. Listen to your heart to make the right choices and find the balance; be creative and convey your enthusiasm; let progress work for you; and believe in yourself.

The desire to cure or to improve the quality of life of patients is driving the development of advanced diagnostics and curative/palliative therapies. Therefore, convergence of chemistry, nanotechnology and medicine that leads to interdisciplinary solutions by bringing together chemists, biologists, physicists, engineers and physicians is the key strategy. Collaboration with Erasmus MC brings us very close to the problem-driven research and hence to the patients as end users.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Biography</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Kristina Djanashvili is Associate Professor at the Department of Biotechnology. Operating at the Reactor Institute Delft, she exploits her expertise in organic-, radio- and nanochemistry as well as physico-chemical methods to design synergic systems for better detection, visualization and treatment of cancer. After introducing this approach in her doctoral research, distinguished with a DEWIS Award for the best female PhD candidate 2009, she has received a prestigious NWO-VENI grant (2013) on nanoparticles for MRI and radiotherapy. Together with her dynamic multidisciplinary research group, she is looking for innovative ways that chemistry can offer to solve medical problems.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://nl.linkedin.com/in/kristina-djanashvili-87a796b4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p>"

                  "<p><strong>Advice for the next generation of female scientists</strong></p><p>Always stay connected to your own needs and dreams, no matter the situation. Sometimes, and hopefully not too often, you need to compromise and attune to a culture you may not like or are not familiar with. Then seek for opportunities to benefit from it. Make your own ideals visible and connect to colleagues that share similar values so you can help each other out. Sooner or later your added value will be recognized. And if not, you can always become a Don(na) Quixote!</p><p><strong>Research's Impact on Society</strong></p><p>In my work I have always been seeking for contributions to societal issues through design. From 1992 to 1995, I was engaged in international design projects in developing areas. One of the results was the publication of a Tricycle Production Manual, which has been distributed worldwide. In 2015, I defended my doctoral thesis <a href=\"https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Afc87dfd1-b7eb-4c84-b6c7-6835c5e837f8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Crossing Cultural Chasms - towards a culture-conscious approach to design</em></a>, and 4 years later my PhD student Chen Hao defended <a href=\"https://books.ipskampprinting.nl/thesis/534345-hao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cultura: Achieving intercultural empathy through contextual user research in design</em></a>. My research focuses on the role of culture in design processes, supporting designers with a culture sensitive approach to design. The higher aim is to contribute to diversity in all its facets. Actual topics addressed are gender and skin colour biases in design.</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/3c9789e4-98e4-d3ce-6096-6dab12df3f7f/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/e0b9ae69-729b-2c33-6d80-426419199236/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><strong>Biography</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/studiolab/vanboeijen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annemiek van Boeijen</a> finished design studies in 1990 with the design of a carbon-fibre racing wheelchair for Veldink BV, presented at the Paralympics 1990 in Assen (NL), and since then displayed in exhibitions, most recently in <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/io/50/exhibition/1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Designed for our Future</em></a> in Delft.

          "Fortunately, there is persistent momentum in Western academia and politics to acknowledge and address gender bias as well as other issues related to diversity and inclusion that have perpetuated inequalities. To address awareness of implicit bias, Harvard has opened its research (and results) on the subject to the public. Challenge yourself to take a test and reflect on your implicit bias and the ways you promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality on campus and throughout your career. Here at TU Delft, like many institutions, diversity officers, initiatives, and networks like DEWIS contribute to improving campus climate and policy for fairness and equality.  "
